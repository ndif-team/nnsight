    "## The Core Paradigm: Interleaving\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write intervention code inside a `with model.trace(...)` block, here's what actually happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Your code is captured** - nnsight extracts the code inside the `with` block\n",
    "2. **The code is compiled** into an executable function  \n",
    "3. **Your code runs in parallel with the model** - as the model executes its forward pass, your intervention code runs alongside it\n",
    "4. **Your code waits for values** - when you access `.output`, your code pauses until the model reaches that point\n",
    "5. **The model provides values via hooks** - PyTorch hooks inject values into your waiting code\n",
    "6. **Your code can modify values** - before the forward pass continues, you can change activations\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called **interleaving** - your intervention code and the model's forward pass take turns executing, synchronized at specific points (module inputs and outputs).\n",

    "1. **Wrapping models** with `NNsight` and `LanguageModel`\n",
    "2. **Accessing activations** with `.output`, `.input`, `.save()`\n",
    "3. **Modifying activations** with in-place and replacement patterns  \n",
    "4. **The interleaving paradigm** - your code runs alongside the model\n",
    "5. **Invokers and batching** - efficient multi-input processing\n",
    "6. **Multi-token generation** - `.generate()` and `.iter` for iterative operations\n",
    "7. **Gradients** - `with tensor.backward():` for gradient access\n",
    "8. **Advanced features** - source tracing, caching, early stopping, scanning\n",
    "9. **Model editing** - persistent modifications with `.edit()`\n",
    "10. **Remote execution** - running on NDIF with `remote=True`\n",
