    "**TorchDynamo** is a Python-level Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler designed to make unmodified PyTorch programs faster. TorchDynamo hooks into the frame evaluation API in CPython ([PEP 523](https://peps.python.org/pep-0523/)) to dynamically modify Python bytecode right before it is executed. It rewrites Python bytecode to extract sequences of PyTorch operations into an [FX Graph](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fx.html) which is then compiled with a customizable backend. It creates this FX Graph through bytecode analysis and is designed to mix Python execution with compiled backends to get the best of both worlds — usability and performance.\n",
