So by accessing the input to the dropdown layer, we get the attention weights before dropout is applied.\n",

        "As an optional bonus exercise, you can verify for yourself that these are the correct attention patterns, by calculating them from scratch using the key and query vectors. Using `model.transformer.h[0].attn.q_proj.output` will give you the query vectors, and `k_proj` for the key vectors. However, one thing to be wary of is that GPT-J uses **rotary embeddings**, which makes the computation of attention patterns from keys and queries a bit harder than it would otherwise be. See [here](https://blog.eleuther.ai/rotary-embeddings/) for an in-depth discussion of rotary embeddings, and [here](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=bef36Bf9k7FYsCt1DpzCw6eV) for some rough intuitions."

But we can actually do both at once: we can compute $h$ within our forward pass, and then intervene with it on a different forward pass (using our zero-shot prompts), all within the same `model.trace` context manager. In other words, **we'll be using `with tracer.invoke...` three times** in this context manager.\n",

        "There's a difficulty here - rather than just getting the `z` vectors, we're actually trying to get the `attn_out` vectors, but *before* they're summed over heads. As we discussed previously, this is a bit tricky to do for the model we're working with, because the `out_proj` linear map actually does the \"project up\" and \"sum over heads\" operations simultaneously. It would be nice to just take a slice of the `out_proj` matrix and multiply it with a slice of the `z` vector, but the `nnsight` library doesn't yet allow users to access weights directly (for security reasons). To understand how we can extract the `attn_out` vector for a head separately without accessing the underlying weights, you should go back to read the subsection **A note on `out_proj`** at the start of this section."

In the exercises below we use a repetition penalty (we choose a value of 1.2, in line with the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05858) that suggested it) - this can avoid the model falling into loops of repeating the same sequence, which is especially common in steering when we're pushing the model OOD.\n",

See [this blog post](https://kipp.ly/transformer-inference-arithmetic/) for more on transformer inference arithmetic.\n",

For example, if we wanted to perform the intervention \"add the function vector to *only* the final sequence position of the prompt for each token we generate\" then we'd have to disable caching (since previous forward passes would contain cached values where we intervened on a sequence position which is no longer the final sequence position). However, here we're performing the intervention \"add the function vector to the final token of the original prompt, and to *all subsequent sequence positions*\", meaning enabling caching (the default behaviour) will give us the right causal intervention.\n",

        "In the final non-bonus exercise of the previous section, we touched on the idea of using function vectors to induce behavioural changes in the model's completions, rather than specifically making it solve zero-shot or corrupted prompts with the right completion. In these next exercises, we'll explore this kind of work in more detail. We'll be primarily using Turner et al's work on [Steering GPT-2-XL by adding an activation vector](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5spBue2z2tw4JuDCx/steering-gpt-2-xl-by-adding-an-activation-vector).\n",

        "* Function vectors focused on the model performing a particular function (e.g. mapping a word to its opposite), whereas this work focuses on behavioural changes (e.g. completing a prompt which has negative tone in a positive way).\n",
        "* Function vectors work looked at very large models (our exercises used Pythia-7B, the smallest model which was examined in the function vectors paper). This particular steering vectors post focused on the smaller models GPT2-Small (85m) and GPT2-XL (1.5B). We'll be focusing on GPT2-XL.\n",
        "* The second half of our function vectors work identified important attention heads and focused on their outputs, rather than just adding to the residual stream directly. In this steering vector setup, we'll go back to the simpler method of adding directly into the residual stream.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these differences, much of the work which was done here overlaps with function vector work, since they both fall into the broader category of *\"finding vectors using forward-pass-based methods (i.e. not with SGD) and using them to intervene on models during forward passes & change the model's output\"*. This description would also include the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "* [Inference-time intervention](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kuQfnotjkQA4Kkfou/inference-time-intervention-eliciting-truthful-answers-from), which focuses on inducing the behavioural change of \"making the model tell the truth\". It also looks at other non-forward-pass-based techniques for finding an intervention vector, e.g. CCS and linear probing, although it concludes that forward-pass-based methods similar to the ones we've been using so far work the best.\n",
        "* [Steering Llama 2 via Contrastive Activation Addition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681), which can be thought of as an extension of the GPT2-XL steering vector work to larger models, specifically Llama 2 13B. It also takes more of a high-level evals framework; measuring the model's change in attributes such as sycophancy, myopia, and power-seeking (finding that these attributes can be increased or decreased by adding the appropriate vectors).\n",

We've provided a function template as well as some example code to run; your main job will be to fill in the function. This will be like a hybrid of several previous exercises (with most similarity to the function `calculate_and_intervene_with_h`), although there will be a few methodological differences.\n",

Rather than adding a single vector to the final sequence position at each token generation, we're adding a slice of vectors to the first sequence positions of the original prompt (see tables like in [this section](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5spBue2z2tw4JuDCx/steering-gpt-2-xl-by-adding-an-activation-vector#1__Love___Hate) for an illustration). How do you think this will affect our function? Should we still cache? Should we be using `.generate()` or `.trace()`? If using `.generate()`, do we need to call `model.next()` ?\n",

        "- We should be using `.generate()` (because we're doing multi-token generation),\n",

There are 2 possible ways you can get around this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Right-pad the input sequences manually, i.e. use something like `len(tokenizer.tokenize(prompt))` to see how long each of the prompts is, and add copies of `tokenizer.pad_token` to the end of each sequence.\n",
        "2. Don't manually pad the input sequences, instead slice the sequences you add to the original prompt from the right side of the activation addition sequences, rather than from the left side.\n",

        "The solutions use (2), but you can use either of these methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sampling\n",
        "\n",
        "Following the post, we'll use top-p sampling with probability 0.3 to generate our sequences. We'll also use a small frequency penalty to penalize repetition (so the model gets stuck in loops less). If you've done earlier exercises in this section then you might have implemented `freq_penalty` during sampling; this is supported by TransformerLens models, but HuggingFace uses the somewhat similar `repetition_penalty` (default value is 1.0 indicating no penalty, values higher than 1.0 apply a penalty to repeated tokens).\n",
        "\n",
        "We apply these sampling methods by passing keyword arguments into the `generate` method:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "{\n",
        "    \"do_sample\": True, # necessary whenever we're sampling rather than doing greedy decoding\n",
        "    \"top_p\": 0.3,\n",
        "    \"repetition_penalty\": 1.1,\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the sequences are generated stochastically rather than greedily - this means we'll get different results if we input multiple different copies of the same sequence. We've given you the `n_comparisons` argument in the function below, i.e. you should generate this many steered *and* this many unsteered completions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Other tips / notes\n",
        "\n",
        "We recommend starting with example #9 (the \"talking about weddings\" one). It seems quite robust to the exact conditions of the forward pass, unlike the `Love - Hate` example. You can use any of the template cells we've given you below.\n",
        "\n",
        "We've given you a `use_bos` argument; if this is True then you should append `tokenizer.bos_token` to the start of all the prompts. This is just to be true to the LessWrong post's implementation; it won't change behaviour much and you can probably ignore it and still get good results."

We can try to trigger unwanted behaviors in models more efficiently by manipulating their internal states during inference rather than searching through many inputs. The idea is that if a behavior can be easily triggered through techniques such as activation engineering, it may also occur in deployment. The inability to elicit behaviors via small internal perturbations could serve as a stronger guarantee of safety.*\n",
